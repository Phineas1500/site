# The Problem

We are in the midst of a digital revolution. Technology is the fastest- growing industry in the country, with hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs and employers desperate for talented students. However, while tech rapidly expands on the coasts, **students in Chicago are being left behind.** Though one of the largest cities in the U.S., local tech opportunities for high schoolers in the city are few and far between. In 2018 alone, more than 150 hackathons for U.S. high schoolers ran with thousands of students in attendance. The entire Midwest had six, the largest of which (Hack Chicago) our team helped run.

# The Solution

On June 22nd in Chicago, IL, we are hosting Windy City Hacks.
In a weekend full of collaboration & creativity, 300 attendees (projected) will bring their ideas to reality, developing skills far beyond merely tech.

With help from experienced Chicagoans, industry professionals’ mentorship, and engaging workshops, students will transform overnight from passive digital consumers into active creators. The city’s future is full of innovation — let’s make sure all students know.

Provide tools. Hackers at our event will use design, testing, development, hosting, deployment, domain registration, and other kinds of tools to create their projects. Providing your company’s software/hardware/ services will put them in the hands of future creators and developers.
