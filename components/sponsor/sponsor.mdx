Founded in 2013, Purdue Hackers is an organization of Purdue students who ship creative technical projects & build marketable skills. We're the largest computer science organization at Purdue, with 1800 members in our community.

# The Problem

Computer Science students often hear from recruiters that the best job applicants have built personal projects. For good reason: building personal projects is the best way to build real-world technical skills that translate to less on-the-job training and higher average performers in the workplace.

But building personal projects is extraordinarily difficult: you have to find something you're deeply interested inâ€”already toughâ€”that teaches you just the right amount of new things so that you're challenged but not overwhelmed. Then, you need to find the time and energy to see the project through, all while juggling academic and social obligations. It's no wonder many students never do it.

College students, especially those in STEM, learn quickly that the best way to master tough coursework is to make friends & form communities around this shared goal. Entire institutions have formed around this idea; they're called learning communities. Purdue Hackers brings this idea to personal projects, creating highly talented & motivated engineers.

# The Solution: Purdue Hackers ðŸ’›âš¡

Purdue Hackers is a learning community for technical projects, like apps, websites, digital art, robotics, and microelectronics: our members form groups & make things together, which we strongly encourage to be weird, wacky, & creative. An average hacker starts a project at one of our hour-long biweekly workshops, builds it with friends at one of our weekly Hack Nights, and ships it in our online community.

The strong community & culture of building unblocks our members, giving them time and energy for building that would otherwise be hard to come by. It also dramatically increases their ambitions: most of our members have made their closest friends & projects they're most proud of within Purdue Hackers.

Hackers have gone on to intern and work at highly-respected companies like Apple, Google, Figma, & Vercel, as well as start their own companies.

# Our Three Programs

## Hack Night

</Grid>

A mini hackathon every Friday night at the local makerspace, with 60 attendees on average. Students have uninterrupted time to work on creative extracurricular projects with friendsâ€”including an object-tracking camera, [an alternative time system](https://lightning-time.vercel.app/), a meter-tall sign powered by a custom PCB, a camera-based drawing website, an (ethical) iOS exploit, and a game about word embeddings, among many others. Hack Night ends very late at night, often as late as 6:00am.

<Tip

career fairs & hackathons due to the high concentration of talent & passion projects."

## Workshops

</Grid>

Hour-long sessions that introduce attendees to a new concept, like [generative art](https://events.purduehackers.com/generative-art-workshop), [shaders](https://events.purduehackers.com/shaders-workshop), [word embeddings](https://events.purduehackers.com/word-embedding-workshop), and [interpreters](https://events.purduehackers.com/programming-languages-workshop). Everyone leaves with a finished project that they can continue working on. Workshops run roughly every two weeks with an attendee count ranging from 50 to 150.

## Community

A vibrant & friendly online community on Discord with 1800 members. Members hear about upcoming events, hang out, form Hack Night groups, & ship their completed projects. We also run asynchronous hackathon-like events, such as [Commit Overflow](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/commit-overflow-2022), which we ran over winter break 2022.

# Where You Come In

Our programs cost $6,000 per year to maintain. Most of our budget is used to purchase food & materials for Hack Night & workshops, as well as occasionally fund student projects. **We are seeking sponsorship to maintain our core programs & expand them to more students at Purdue.**

In return, we will partner with you on a workshop, Hack Night, or other event of your choice ([example](https://events.purduehackers.com/-hammerwars-)), through which you will gain direct recruiting access to our uniquely talented members.
